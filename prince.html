        <h1>15 Tips for Traveling Europe</h1>
        <p>So you’ve done it—bought your tickets for a vacation in Europe and eager to see the sights- or you’ve at
            least decided that “Europe” is your next destination!

            From east to west, Europe is a mixture of cultures, languages, heritage, architecture, and customs all
            across the continent. The dissolution of border checks within the EU means that travel in Europe has never
            been easier, more affordable or more convenient!.Europe can be a mess in peak-travel season, with crowds and
            queues lining up in Paris and London, and even smaller hamlets like Avignon and Verona. Avoid the months of
            June, July, and August if you’d rather not stand in long lines and crowds to see the Mona Lisa or the
            Sistine Chapel.

            Plus, summertime is when Europeans themselves head elsewhere for vacation, so my suggestion to get a real
            feel on what locals are like in your destination, visit cusp-season- early spring or in the fall!</p>

        <p class="spara">Practice a few phrases before you arrive and use them with locals if you feel comfortable. In
            most cases,
            they’ll appreciate a tourist trying to speak the local tongue.

            Try listening to a few podcasts to get the right pronunciation, or spend some time with a language program
            like Rosetta Stone leading up to your trip.
            You’re here to meet and mingle with locals, so you might as well support local businesses, and while you’re
            at it, you can even try a ‘Bonjour’ or ‘Ciao’ with them. Restaurants and shops off the main roads tend to be
            cheaper anyways!

            Helpful Tip: Restaurants with pictures on the menu tend to cater to a tourist crowd, which means their
            prices are marked up as well. Learn some food phrases in your destination’s language, or carry a translator,
            so you don’t need the pictures anyways!</p>
